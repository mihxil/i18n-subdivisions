= I18n Country Subdivisions

== Overview

Package to support internationalization, specifically the Subdivision (provinces/states/region)
defined in ISO 3166-2.

It depends on the neovisionaries i18n (nv-i18n) package for defining all the CountryCodes used.

This is formed from https://github.com/tobias-/i18n-subdivisions which doesn't seem to be maintained.

The author is well aware that there are bound to be problems in the data set. If nothing else, the data changes over time, so please submit issues when something is wrong (preferably with a verifiably link to the correct data).

While the information on what kind of subdivision it is (region, island, state, province, city etc), they are too many different kinds for them to be readily usable and thus they are not available.
